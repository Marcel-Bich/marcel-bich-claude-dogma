# Naming Rules

<rules>
1. **Confirm name before implementation** - Renaming later is expensive
2. **Identical DE+EN** - Name must work in both languages without translation
3. **Clarity over brevity** - Long clear names beat short cryptic ones
4. **Prefix for type** - `claude-` for plugins, `mcp-` for servers, etc.
5. **ASCII only** - No umlauts, special chars in technical names
</rules>

For details see `GUIDES/naming.md`
