# Code Review Rules

<rules>
1. **Review before merge** - All code must be reviewed (even solo: self-review).
2. **Constructive feedback** - Suggest improvements, don't just criticize.
3. **Tests required** - No approval without passing tests.
4. **Small PRs** - Keep PRs focused and reviewable (<400 lines).
5. **Check for security** - Review for secrets, injection, auth issues.
</rules>
