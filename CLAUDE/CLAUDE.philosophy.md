# Philosophy

Core principles. These are guidelines, not laws - break them freely if they hinder you.

<rules>
1. **YAGNI** - Prefer implementing only what's needed now
2. **KISS** - Prefer the simplest solution that works
3. **Rule of Three** - Prefer waiting until 3rd repetition before abstracting
4. **Small Functions** - Prefer shorter functions with single responsibility
5. **Start Monolith** - Prefer monolith until splitting is clearly needed
6. **Composition > Inheritance** - Prefer composition over deep inheritance
7. **Readability > Cleverness** - Prefer clear code over clever code
</rules>

<soft_metrics>
Aim for, but don't force:
- Complexity < 10, functions < 30 lines, params < 4, nesting < 3
</soft_metrics>
