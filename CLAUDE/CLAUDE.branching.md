# Branching Rules

<rules>
1. **main = production-ready** - Never commit broken code to main.
2. **Feature branches** - Use `feature/name` for new features, `fix/name` for bugs.
3. **Pull requests** - All changes via PR, no direct commits to main.
4. **Delete after merge** - Remove feature branches once merged.
5. **Keep branches short-lived** - Merge frequently to avoid conflicts.
</rules>
