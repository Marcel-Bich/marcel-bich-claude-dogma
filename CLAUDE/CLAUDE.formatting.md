# Formatting Rules

<rules>
1. **Prettier as standard** - Use Prettier for consistent formatting.
2. **Never auto-format legacy code** - Ask user before reformatting existing files.
3. **Format only changed files** - In legacy projects, format only files you modify.
4. **Check before commit** - Run `pnpm format:check` before committing.
5. **EditorConfig for basics** - Use EditorConfig for cross-editor consistency.
